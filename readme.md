# A SoundType System for Secure Flow Analysis

For this project, I try to code inside Lean the paper by Volpano, Smith and
Irvine [A SoundType System for Secure Flow Analysis](http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~smithg/papers/jcs96.pdf).
Lemma 6.5, 6.6, 6.7 and theorems
6.8 are left out.

## Modules overview
- **base**, simple module that stores the basic literals value
- **map**, definition of map based on alist, this object would be
  instantiate to be one of the context in both the typing rules and evaluation
  function
- **context**, this module build the instance of the state, identifier and
  location map
- **security_class**, I defined the security class inductive type and the
  relative ≤ operator, the only values allowed for security classes are High and
  Low
- **phrase**, this is the wrapper of the security_class, with this module I can
  type every expression or program inside the framework
- **semantics**, this module stores the program syntax definition and (big-step)
  evaluation rule
- **type_system**, regards the paper, this is the first typing systems showed in
  the paper, these rules are combined with the subtype and the fact that phrase
  is partially ordered
- **syntax_directed**, this typing systems differs from the previous one by the
  subtyping rule, which is included inside (almost) each rule
- **lemmata/phrase_partial_order**, proof that phrase is partially ordered, by
  an instance of partial_order over phrase
- **lemmata/structural_subtyping**, properties about the ≤ operation over
  phrases (lemma 4.1)
- **lemmata/syntax_directed**, property about subtype (lemma 6.1) and the proof
  that the two type systems defined are equivalent (lemma 6.2)
- **lemmata/type_soundness**, simple security (lemma 6.3) and confinement
  (lemma 6.4) properties
